This is a copy of the last updated version of WP-Bootstrap v3.3.1 [Internet Atchive Link](http://web.archive.org/web/20141202223153/http://320press.com/wpbs/) the Wordpress theme by Chris Barnes (domain is dead http://cbarn.es).

It is used as a parent theme for the [DS106 Assignment Banker Theme](https://github.com/cogdog/ds106bank) and the [Daily Blank theme](https://github.com/cogdog/dailyblank). There is little reason to be concerned now about using a theme no longer maintained or updated- I use it all the time.

It is provided here as a stand along GitHub repo to make installs a bit easier. It can be uploaded directly to your self-hosted wordpress site as a ZIP file.
